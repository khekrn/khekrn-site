Thanks for visiting my blog. My name is Kishore Karunakaran. Iâ€™m a Software Engineer from India and love solving problems. My desire to solve problems started from my college days and ever since I try not to restrict myself when it comes to technology, and strive to constantly learn new things.

Currently working on building reliable and scalable financial systems. Research and Software development on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Distributed Systems.
