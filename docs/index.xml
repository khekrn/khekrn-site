      <description>Introduction Probabilistic data structure is a data structure which always provides approximated answers, but with reliable ways to estimate possible errors. Basically, it stores a summary of data instead of storing the entire data that&amp;rsquo;s why it gives us approximate results instead of deterministic results. The errors are compensated with low memory requirements, constant query/lookup time, scaling and many other factors which are essential in distributed data applications.
Use Cases  Google Bigtable, Apache HBase and Apache Cassandra, Postgresql and many more databases use Probabilistic data structures to reduce the disk lookups for non-existent rows or columns.</description>
