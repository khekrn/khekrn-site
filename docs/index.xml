      <description>Suppose let&amp;rsquo;s say you are signing up for the new Email id. When you enter a new mail id,respective mail service will check whether the given mail id already exists.
So how can we build such a kind of systems ?
No, we cannot keep all email id&amp;rsquo;s in memory because it&amp;rsquo;s not practical. We can store all email id&amp;rsquo;s on disk and we can read from the disk and check whether the given mail id exists or not, but reading and writing to disk is time consuming.</description>
